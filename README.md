We are building a system that allows a user to collect and return a bike from a docking station. Bikes can get broken whilst being used, and users can report a broken bike. Broken bikes get taken to the garage to be fixed by a van, and this van returns fixed bikes from the garage to the docking station. Users want to know the availability for bikes, and docking stations, the van and the garage all have a maximum capacity for bikes. Van needs to know where broken bikes are located.
